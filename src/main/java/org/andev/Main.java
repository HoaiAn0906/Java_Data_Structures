/*Requirements for Implementing an ArrayList
Dynamic Resizing

Unlike regular arrays, an ArrayList should dynamically resize itself when elements are added or removed.
Use an internal array that doubles its size when the capacity is exceeded.
        Core Functionalities

Add Elements: Support adding elements at the end or a specific index.
Remove Elements: Remove elements by index or value.
Get Elements: Access elements by index.
Set Elements: Update elements at a specific index.
Size: Return the number of elements currently in the ArrayList.
        Capacity: Keep track of the maximum number of elements the internal array can hold.
        Error Handling

Handle invalid operations, such as accessing or removing an element at an out-of-bound index.
Iterator

Implement a way to iterate over the elements (optional, but common for ArrayLists).*/
